The railway is the most convenient and low-cost mode of transportation 
in just position to other modes and also plays a prominent role in the
 economic blooming of the country. The rail carries both freight and
 passengers. Railways carry over 30 million passengers and 2.8 million
 tons of freight daily. India's railway network is recognized as one of

To have an effective means of transport, a proper surveillance system is 
necessary for railroad crack analysis the most awaited problem in railroad 
maintenance is the shortage of cheap and efficient technology to detect track flaws.
 An effective track surveying system is the need of the day for regularity in monitoring the predefined issue.
The proposed system has been assembled with the arrangement of IR and ultrasonic sensors for crack and obstacle detection in a precise way.
 The control unit consists of an Arduino Uno board, which is helpful to interface the GSM module for transmitting the message of the faulted
 crack found to the concerned authority. an IR sensor has been attached with it for detecting cracks so that the defect gets readily available to the concerned
 authority station.
